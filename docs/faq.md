## What’s the latest version of the field guide?

The field guide is on v2.0.0.

<!--
BTW, you can check to see if you have the latest version by looking at the copyright page in the book, and comparing that  with the [latest release]() on Github.
-->

## Who is this book for?

Photographers who are new to China, or at least new to the Beijing area, will get the most out of The Field Guide. Nearly everyone arrives in Beijing with the same questions. The Field Guide gives you quick answers to those questions, and tackles a few issues you probably haven't anticipated yet.


## How do you read the Field Guide?

Because it's an ebook, you can read the Field Guide on your phone, tablet or computer.

You can use any app that supports .epub files. Off the top of my head: iBooks, [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) and Kobo all support .epub files. Axet’s [Book Reader](https://axet.gitlab.io/android-book-reader/) is quickly becoming my personal favorite.

The book was written for travelers who need quick answers, and is designed so it's easy to read on your phone.


## Can you still read it on Kindle?

Yes. You can read it [here.](https://www.amazon.com/Photographers-Field-Guide-Beijing-McCabe-ebook/dp/B072FVKP45/)


## Who won't like this book?

This book isn't for everyone. There are no reviews of tourist attractions. There are no lessons about f-stops or composition, either.


## Wait, do you need to be a pro to use this book?

Nope. The only thing I assume is that you're new to China. The Field Guide helps you get to know Beijing from a photographer's perspective.


## What's so great about Beijing?

The art. The architecture. The attitude. Expect photo ops of a vibrant city that is not shy about owning it's cultural wealth – or showing it off. You'll also have opportunties to photograph floating fields of summer lotus blossoms, autumn streets lined with ginko trees and the Great Wall.


## Who sponsored this project, then?

I don't accept free fish or any other payment for mentions. There are no affiliate links. There are no secret sponsors.

Readers asked for my opinions and expertise, and I value that.


## Why do you need this book?

The Field Guide gives you 3 things:

1. Quick logistics advice from a photographer's point of view.
2. Bite-sized cultural tips. Get your shots. Avoid faux pas.
3. A brief, and carefully curated, location list to help you hit the ground running.

The Field Guide was intentionally written to give you essential info and then get out of your way, so that you can get on with making photos.



## Troubleshooting Chinese text on old Kindle e-ink hardware

iPhones, Android phones and Kindle hardware all typically display Chinese language text just fine. Some early Kindle e-ink devices may require you to fiddle with your font settings to display Chinese characters, though.

(Apparently, only some of Kindle’s fonts will display Chinese properly on older devices.)

If you see little tofu blocks instead of Chinese characters, you’ll need to change your e-reader’s font settings:

 1. Hit the little **Aa icon** at the top of your screen to toggle the font settings options. This preference pane will let you choose a different font.
 2. Tap through your font options until the weird, little tofu boxes disappear and you can see Chinese characters alongside the English language text.


## Why write a field guide?

After hearing visiting photographers ask the same questions over and over, I decided it was time to do something about it. Books are self-contained and offline. That might be handy when you’re inside the great firewall.


## Do you have a different question?

Read all this way and still looking for answers – we can’t have that. Please email me and let’s figure it out together: <hello@zachmccabe.com>
