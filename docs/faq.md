### Who is this book for?

Photographers who are new to China, or at least new to the Beijing area, will get the most out of The Field Guide. Nearly everyone arrives in Beijing with the same questions. The Field Guide gives you quick answers to those questions, and tackles a few issues you probably haven't anticipated yet.



### How do I read the Field Guide?

Because it's an ebook, you can read the Field Guide on your phone, tablet or computer. The book was written for travelers who need quick answers and is designed so it's easy to read on your phone. 

Right now, the book is only available as an ebook via Amazon's Kindle platform. To read it:

1. Download the [Kindle app](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/fd/kcp).
2. Buy the book using your Amazon account.
3. Pack your camera bagâ€¦

You donâ€™t need to sit down and read it cover to cover. Just use your phone or iPad and flip through the Field Guide for quick answers.

> Prefer to read the book in another format? [Let me know](mailto:hello@zachmccabe.com) and I'll consider it for the next edition.



### Who won't like this book?

This book isn't for everyone. There are no reviews of tourist attractions. There are no lessons about f-stops or composition, either. Before you buy, download the [free preview](https://www.amazon.com/Photographers-Field-Guide-Beijing-McCabe-ebook/dp/B072FVKP45/) via Kindle and see for yourself.


### Wait, do I need to be a pro to use this book?

Nope. The only thing I assume is that you're new to China. The Field Guide helps you get to know Beijing from a photographer's perspective.


### What's so great about Beijing?

The art. The architecture. The attitude. Expect photo ops of a vibrant city that is not shy about owning it's cultural wealth â€“ or showing it off. You'll also have opportunties to photograph floating fields of summer lotus blossoms, autumn streets lined with ginko trees and the Great Wall.


### Who sponsored this project, then?

I don't accept free fish or any other payment for mentions. There are no affiliate links. There are no secret sponsors.

Readers asked for my opinions and expertise, and I value that.

Want to sponsor this project? Buy yourself a copy of [the Field Guide.](https://www.amazon.com/Photographers-Field-Guide-Beijing-McCabe-ebook/dp/B072FVKP45/) ðŸ˜‰


### Why do I need this book?

The Field Guide gives you 3 things:

1. Quick logistics advice from a photographer's point of view.
2. Bite-sized cultural tips. Get your shots. Avoid faux pas.
3. A brief, and carefully curated, location list to help you hit the ground running.

The Field Guide was intentionally written to give you essential info and then get out of your way, so that you can get on with making photos.


### When will the book be updated?

Big changes are coming to The Field Guide in Q4 2019. You can learn more [here.](https://www.zachmccabe.com/beijing/#book-updates)


### Which other cities are you going to write about?

We'll see. [Email me](mailto:hello@zachmccabe.com) and tell me which location you want covered!


### Why did you write this book?

Beijing is my second home. I am excited to share it with you.

I wrote this book so you can spend _more_ of your time focusing on photography, and less time worrying about logistics.

After hearing visiting photographers ask the same questions over and over, I decided it was time to do something about it.
